# Web Beacons

This repository collates experiments concerned with establishing low-resource web-beacons, automating remote resource-logging, and utilizing many of the more esoteric HTTP status codes and the myriad interesting things we can do with them.

To date, the following endeavors have endured trial successfully:
 - Embedding a counter beacon inside of image byte-code. 
 - Data harvesting via Beacon API
 - Data harvesting via pure JS tracking pixel (written from scratch; no pre-generated tokens)
